## 🚀 Project Overview

The **E-Library with User-Based Recommendation System** is an innovative platform designed to centralize access to study materials and improve the student learning experience through personalized content recommendations. Our platform combines a digital library with intelligent recommendation algorithms, along with features to manage offline libraries.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Students currently lack a centralized and efficient platform to access, share, and discover relevant study materials. Existing solutions miss out on personalized recommendations, leading to time-consuming searches for appropriate resources.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Our platform provides:
- A **comprehensive digital library** for students to access, upload, and share study materials.
- **Personalized content recommendations** powered by intelligent algorithms.
- An **offline library management system** for handling physical resources.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Resource Access & Upload**: Easy-to-use interface for uploading and browsing study materials.
- **Recommendation System**: Suggests relevant study materials based on user behavior.
- **Search and Filter Options**: Advanced filters for efficient discovery of resources.
- **Rating & Feedback System**: Community-driven ratings to highlight high-quality materials.
- **History**: A way for users to maintain their loggings for which material they have lended.
- **Bookmarking-system**: Bookmarking system for users to bookmark their favourite resources/books.
- **Offline Library Management System**: Manage physical library resources offline.
- **3 Role-Based Access Control**: Distinct roles with specific permissions for users, librarians, and admins.
