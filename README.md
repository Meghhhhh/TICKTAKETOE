## ❗ Problem Statement

Students currently lack a centralized and efficient platform to access, share, and discover relevant study materials. Existing solutions miss out on personalized recommendations, leading to time-consuming searches for appropriate resources.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Our platform provides:
- A **comprehensive digital library** for students to access, upload, and share study materials.
- **Personalized content recommendations** powered by intelligent algorithms.
- An **offline library management system** for handling physical resources.
